# avax-adv-1 mySubnet


This solidity project consists of two contracts IERC20-Vault.sol and ERC20.sol whic were pre provided to us. They have been used for the testing purposes of our subnet deployment

## Description

First I created a local subnet using avalanche CLI.
We airdropped 1Million tokens named PRIYSUBNET into the account and later used them to check the functions we have created for our DeFi app.

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:



To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile IERC20-VAULT.sol" button.

Select the environment as Inject Provider and use the local subnet accoount

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. 
Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the functions.
